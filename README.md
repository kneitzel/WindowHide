WindowHide
==========

Small windows application that hides away the console window of an command line tool. It is not really useful but I am using this tool to start plink.exe (part of putty) without getting an annoying console window.

The tool is written in C# and required teh correct .Net Framework.

The tool cannot do much right now but feel free to send feature requests and/or bug reports to me.
